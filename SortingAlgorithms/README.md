# Sorting Algorithms in Java

This is a **training project** that demonstrates how to implement various sorting algorithms in Java. The goal is to show how these algorithms work step by step. 

Please note that this project is **for learning purposes** and the implementations may not be the most optimized or recommended for production systems.

## Included Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Disclaimer

- This project is **for training purposes only**.
- The implementations prioritize clarity and simplicity over performance or advanced optimization.
- These are **basic implementations** and may not handle all edge cases or real-world scenarios.
- The project is intended to help beginners understand the core logic behind each sorting algorithm.
